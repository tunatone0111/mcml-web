                Human-Centered Multimedia Computing
              </h4>
              The amount of multimedia data (including images, videos, music,
              speech, etc.) has been exploding around us. Since multimedia data
              are ultimately consumed by human users, how to process and manage
              such data in the viewpoint of humans is an important research
              issue. Toward human-centered multimedia services, we work on
              developing multimedia processing technologies based on human
              perceptual mechanisms, including perceptual quality evaluation,
              image/video analysis, content recommendation, image/video
              enhancement, mobile video transmission, etc.

              </div>
              <h4 className="index-theme-title">Human-Like Machine Learning</h4>
              Implementation of multimedia processing techniques often requires
              human-like computing. In particular, we conduct research on
              machine learning, which mimics humans' capability of learning
              generalized knowledge from examples. Topics include neural
              networks, deep learning, multimodal data learning, bio-inspired
              stochastic optimization, etc.
